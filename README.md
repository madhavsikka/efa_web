1. Fork our repo from https://github.com/keshavsethi/efa_web.
2. In the console, download a copy of your forked repo with `git clone https://github.com/your_username/efa_web.git` where `your_username` is your GitHub username.
3. Enter the new **efa_web** directory with `cd efa_web`.
4.Open html file and inform me in case of any issue

### Windows Installation (This is for those who wants to further contribute in other projects but for this windows is fine)

We recommend you either work in a virtual environment, or on a dual booted system to avoid dependencies issues and also Unix system works smoother in this case but windows is fine as well. 
1. [Dual Booting](https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-alongside-with-windows-dual-boot/amp/), [option2](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031993/how-to-install-ubuntu-18-04-alongside-windows-10), [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNeJvujdB-0&fbclid=IwAR0APhs89jlNR_ENKbSwrp6TI6P-wxlx-a0My9XBvPNAfwtADZaAXqcKtP4)
